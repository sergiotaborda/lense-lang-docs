== Operators

Lense supports operators with a special kind of operator overloading. There are two types of operators : intrinsic and definable.

Intrinsic operators are native to the language and their behaviour cannot be redefined. On the other hand, the set of available operators for redefinition is limited ( we do not what symbolic noise ) but extended enought to be usefull in a mathematical or engineering context.
Definable operators are translated to calls to methods. Intrinsic operators are not translated to method calls.


Symbols are gathered from different sources. Lense pays special attention to algebraic structures that are related to the operators and symbols, this means, for example, that the symbol implies if the operation is comutable or not. As a rule of thumb, doubled symbols always represent non-comutative operations. For example,we use `^^` for exponentiation that we now is always non-comutative and `^` for the XOR operator that is always comutative. On te same token we use `+` for comutative sum and `++` for non cumutative concatenation.



=== Intrinsic Operators

Intrinsic operators cannot be redefined and are specially handled by the compiler.

.Intrinsic Operators
[cols="1,1,4"]
|=======
| *Operator* 				| *Example* 								|     
| `===` 					| `a === b`									| Determines if two objects have the same identity. Only objects of type `Identifiable` can use this operator
| `!==` 					| `a !== b`									| Determines if two objects have *not* the same identity. Only objects of type `Identifiable` can use this operator 
| `+` (infix) 				| `+a`										| Does nothing. An infix `+` signed is ignored after parsing. It does not turn a negative value into a positive value.
| `&&` 						| `a && b`									| *a* and *b* must be `Boolean`. Performs an *AND* logic operation on the operands but only if *a* is `true`. Otherwise simply return `false`. Because of the short-circuit behaviour this is not a commutative operator.
| `\|\|` 					| `a \|\| b`								| *a* and *b* must be `Boolean`. Performs an *OR* logic operation on the operands but only if *a* is `false`. Otherwise simply return `true`.Because of the short-circuit behaviour this is not a commutative operator.
| `!` (infix)				| `!a`										| *a* must be `Boolean`. Returns the logic complement of *a*. 
|=======

=== Definable Operators

Lense supports the following definable operators:

.Definable Operators
[cols="1,1,1,1,3"]
|=======
| *Operator* 	| *Example* | *Translates To*	| *Operator Interface*	|      
| `==` 			| `a == b`	| `a.equals(b)`		| `Equatable`			| Determines if two objects are equal. 
| `!=` 			| `a != b`	| `!a.equals(b)`	| `Equatable`			| Determines if two objects are *not* equal.
| `+` 			| `a + b`	| `a.plus(b)`		| `Summable<A,D,S>`		| Sums two values and returns a third value. Prefer the + operator for *commutative* monoid operations with zero as identity element.
| `++` 			| `a ++ b`	| `a.concat(b)`		| `Concatenatable<A,D,S>`| Concatenates two values and returns a third value. Prefer the ++ operator for *non commutative* monoid operations with empty as identity element 
| `-` 			| `a - b`	| `a.minus(b)`		| `Subtractable<A,D,S>` | Substracts two values and returns a third value. This operator represents a *non commutative* operation
| `*` 			| `a * b`	| `a.multiply(b)`	| `Multiplyable<P,A,B>` | Multiplies the two values and returns in a third value. Prefer the * operator for *commutative* monoid operations with one as identity.
| `^^` 			| `a ^^ b`	| `a.raiseTo(b)`	| `Dividable<Q,N,D>` 	| Raises the first operand to the power of the second operand and returns the result in a third value. Prefer the ^^ operator for *non commutative* monoid operations with one as identity.
| `/` 			| `a / b`	| `a.divide(b)`		| `Dividable<Q,N,D>` | Divides the two values and returns a third value. The operand values are not changed in any way. This operator represents a *non commutative* operation.
| `\` 			| `a \ b`	| `a.wholeDivide(b)`| `WholeDividable<W>` | Performs whole division the two values and returns a third value. The operand values are not changed in any way. This operator represents a *non commutative* operation.
| `%` 			| `a % b`	| `a.remainder(b)`	| `WholeDividable<W>` | Divides the two values and returns the remainder of integer division. This operator represents a *non commutative* operation.  Note that it always should be true that `a == a \ b + a % b`
| `-` (infix) 	| `-a`		| `a.symmetric()`	| `Symmetrical<T,R>` |  Returns the symmetric value. Keep in mind the type needs not be closed for subtraction. For `Natural`s, for example the symmetric value is an `Integer`.
| `~` (infix) 	| `~a`		| `a.complement()`	| `Complementable<T,R>` |  Returns the complement of the value. For `Binary` values it is equivalent to flipping all bits. For complex numbers is represents the conjugate so that  `~(a + ib) == a - ib`
| `&`  			| `a & b`	| `a.and(b)`		| `Injunctable<R,A,B>` | Injucts the two values and returns a third value. For binary forms, this implements a bitwise AND. For sets this implements intersection
| `\|`  		| `a \| b`	| `a.or(b)`		| Dijunctable<R,A,B> | Dijuncts the two values and returns a third value. For binary forms, this implements a bitwise OR . For sets this implements union
| `^`  			| `a ^ b`	| `a.xor(b)`		| `ExclusivelyDijunctable<R,A,B>` | Exclusively dijunsts the two values and returns a third value. For binary forms, this implements a bitwise XOR
| `<=>`  		| `a <=> b`	| `a.compareTo(b)`	| `Comparable<T>` 	| Compared the order of the values of *a* and *b*. Returns `Comparison.equal`, `Comparison.greater` or `Comparison.lesser` if , respectively, a = b, a > b and a < b.  The operand values are not changed in any way.
| `>`  			| `a > b`	| `a.compareTo(b) == Comparison.greater`| `Comparable<T>` | Returns `true` if *a* is great than *b*, `false` otherwise. 
| `>=`  		| `a > b`	| `a.compareTo(b) != Comparison.lesser`	| `Comparable<T>` | Returns `true` if *a* is great or equals to *b*, `false` otherwise. 
| `<`  			| `a < b`	| `a.compareTo(b) == Comparison.lesser`	| `Comparable<T>` | Returns `true` if *a* is less than *b*, `false` otherwise. 
| `<=`  		| `a <= b`	| `a.compareTo(b) != Comparison.greater`	| `Comparable<T>` | Returns `true` if *a* is less or equal to *b*, `false` otherwise.
| `..`  		| `a .. b`	| `a.upTo(b)`		| `Progressable<T>` | Returns a Progression that starts at *a* and ends at *b*. 
| `..<`  		| `a ..< b`	| `a.upToExclude(b)`| `Progressable<T>` | Returns a Progression that starts at *a* and ends at *b* but not contains *b*. 
| `>>`  		| `a >> n`	| `a.rightShiftBy(n)`| `Binary<T>` | The arithmetic right shift operator returns a value equivalent to the original with bits moved to the right *n* times. This is equivalent to division by 2 *n* times for positive numeric values.
| `<<`  		| `a << n`	| `a.leftShiftBy(n)`| `Binary<T>` | The arithmetic left shift operator returns a value equivalent to the original with bits moved to the left *n* times. This is equivalent to multiplication by 2 *n* times for positive numeric values. 
| _empty space_ | `a b`		| `a.juxtapose(b)`	| `Juxtaposable<A,B,R>` | This is an operator with no symbol that means the two operands are simply "put together". This may mean a kind of multiplication like in `2 Kg` , or in matrix multiplication like `A B`. The juxtapose operator is *non commutative*.
|=======


=== Ternary operators 

==== Ternary Select operator 
This operator test for the first term to be true. In the positive case returns the second term. Otherwise returns the third.

[source,lense ]
----
let c = (a == b) ? 1 : 4;
----


==== Ternary Comparison operator 
This operator compares the second term with the other ones according to the comparison operators use in between them an returns true if both sides are true

[source,lense ]
----
let isTeenager =  13 <= x <= 19;
----

This operator is equivalent to 

[source,lense ]
----
let isTeenager =  13 <= x && x <= 19
----

but, we do not need to use the `&&` operator nor type the variable `x` twice. 
Also this operator is equivalent to

[source,lense ]
----
let isTeenager = x in |[ 13 , 19 ]|;
----

but we do not need to create and interval object to text x agains it.

=== A note on Increment and Decrement operators (Under consideration)

The infix `--a` and `++b` operators are transformed to calls into `predecessor` and `successor`. For example, this code:

[source,lense ]
----
let a : Integer= 3;
let b : Integer = ++a;
----

At the end of this code, both *a* and *b* are 4.
Is equivalent to

[source,lense ]
----
var  a : Integer = 3;
a = a.successor();
let b :Integer = a;
----

As you can see the value in the variable is incremented implicitly as you would expect, however a new object is created and the reference is redirected to this new object. 

The suffix operators `a--` and `a++` are also transformed to calls into `predecessor` and `successor`, but in a different sequence. For example:

[source,lense ]
----
let a : Integer= 3;
let b : Integer = a++;
----

At the end of this code, *b* is 3 and *a* is 4.
is translated internally to

[source,lense ]
----
var a : Integer = 3;
let b : Integer = a;
a = a.successor();
----

=== Composed assignment operators

Consider the following operator statement:

[source,lense ]
----
var a : Integer = 3;

a+=5;

----

The `+=` is a composed assignment operator. Where the `a+=5` statement is equivalent to:

[source,lense ]
----
var a : Integer = 3;

a = a + 5;

----

All composed assignment operator are decomposed by the compiler in an assignment an a call to the root operator. 


.Composed assignment operators
|=======
| `+=` | `-=` | `*=` | `/=` | `\=`
| `&=` | `\|=` | `^=` | `<<=` | `>>=`
|=======

Remember that assignments are statements in Lense, so the following code does not compile:

[source,lense ]
----
var a : Integer = 3;

if (a+=5 > 7){
  // do something
}

----

This one does:

[source,lense ]
----
var a : Integer = 3;

a+=5;

if (a > 7){
  // do something
}

----
