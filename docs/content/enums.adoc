== Sealed Types and Objects

Lense supports limiting the sub types a type can have. Algo the objetcs a type can have. The first raises the possibility of sealed types, 
the second is a mecanhism similar to enums in other languages.

Sealed Types in Lense, form a tree of types with objects as leafs. We can define a sealed types combining the `abstract` modifier with the `Ã¬s` clause  , so:

[source, lense]
----
public abstract class ExpressionNode is OperationNode , ValueNode {  //(1)

}

public class OperationNode extends ExpressionNode is sum , multiplication  { //(2)

}

public object sum extends OperationNode  { //(3)

}

public object multiplication extends OperationNode  { //(3)

}

public class ValueNode extends ExpressionNode { //(4)

	constructor (public value: Integer);  //(5)
}
----

We define an `ExpressionNode` (*1*) class that can only have two sub classes: `OperationNode` and `ValueNode`.
`OperationNode` can then only have two instances (*2*) called `sum` and `multiplication`. These are instances because they are defined as objects (*3*).
`ValueNode` is also a `ExpressionNode` (*4*) but can have multiple instances, one for each `Integer`

NOTE: In Lense, object names are writen in camel case, while types names are writen in Pascal Case.

The explicit definition of `sum` and `multiplication` is optional if no constructors or methods need to be defined.

This mechanism allows the compiler to test for exaustivness when necessary.  For example, we define `Boolean` as:


[source, lense]
----

public abstract class Boolean is true , false  {
 ...
} 
----

The compiler then knows that the only possible values of a `Boolean` are `true` and `false`. Likewise, we define Maybe as :

[source, lense]
----
public abstract class Maybe<out T> is Some<T> ,  none {
}

public class Some<T> extends Maybe<T> {
	public constructor (value : T);
} 
----

The compiler then knows that the only possible instances of Maybe are `none` and all instances of `Some`.

== Enums

If we only desire to enumerate the possible instances of a type we can write: 

[source, lense]
----
public abstract class Comparison is equal, greater, smaller {

}
----
