== Status

Lense is currently in the *Experimentation Stage*. The language features are being defined and experimentation is underway to understand how they interact together. 

At this point is it already possible to compile to java backend and run a program. Many features are already supported, but some are still being explored.

== Roadmap

In a given stage we focus on reaching the stage goals. This does not mean no work is done in other stages but this work is done 
to explore some decision consequences or ascertain future difficulties and can change once we move to that stage. 

1. <<envision-stage, Envision Stage>>
2. <<exploration-stage, Exploration Stage>>
3. <<experimentation-stage, *Experimentation Stage*>>
4. <<embrace-stage, Embrace Stage>>
5. <<expand-stage, Expand Stage>>
6. <<evolve-stage, Evolve Stage>>

[[envision-stage]]
=== Envision Stage

Decide on the core concepts, the supporting syntax and related keywords.  At this stage the work is mainly about definition of a BNF grammar and the parser rules.
These rules need to be validated and being able to obtain the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the language.

Define primary design rules like the double-symbol operator o mean the operator is not comuutable.

[[exploration-stage]]
=== Exploration Stage

Work for this stage focus on how to assure the core feature can be available and viable in a multi-platform scenario. 
At this stage some work is made on the infrastructure necessary to transform the AST to other intermediary representations and finally to bytecodes.
The interaction with native code and libraries is also studied at this stage. A way to create and resolve modules - and type in modules - is also explored.
Finally a base for an IO API is provided


[[experimentation-stage]]
=== Experimentation Stage

Be able to compile and run an output only Console Application in a target platform. The Java Virtual Machine is the first candidate but several others are possible.
At this stage some work is made to validate the feature does run on the  target platform.

Module resolution and type resolution in modules is also validated at this stage.

[[embrace-stage]]
=== Embrace Stage

Produce several auxiliar modules to the core module. Differentiate modules by platform and consider separated assemblers for each target platform

[[expand-stage]]
=== Expand Stage

Compile to other platforms like Javascript, TypeScript or Dart. Produce modules specific to those platforms or that are available only in some platforms.

[[evolve-stage]]
=== Evolve Stage 

Discover new opportunities for better integration with platforms, better plataform independence and better performance.


== Features Status 


|===
| Feature          						| Description																				|  Status 		
|   Strong Static Typing with Inference	| all objects have a type at compile time, and the compiler can infer most types			|  Embrace
|   Flow Sensitive Typing    			| casts are not necessary when the compiler knows a variable is already of a given type		|  Embrace	
|   Numeric Tower 			   			| support for Natural, Integer , Rational, Imaginary and Complex numbers					|  Embrace	
|   Power Operator 			   			| support for a power operator (`^^`)														|  Embrace	
|   Enhancements						| you can use Enhancements to add methods to types you donâ€™t control.						|  Embrace
|   Method Overriding					| allow the derived class to re-implement a method from the base classes					|  Embrace
|   Method Overloading					| allow the same method name with different signature										|  Embrace
|   No nulls 							| do not allow variables and fields to be null. use maybe monad								|  Experimentation (not clear if needs maybe erasure)
|	Modules								| the compiler produces modules with dependency and version information on other modules.	|  Experimentation ( resolve multiples modules )
|   Single Inheritance 					| Single Inheritance for classes , multiple inheritance for interface						|  Experimentation	(need traits)
|   Sealed Type Hierarchies    			| you can limit the instances of a type and/or the types that inherit from it				|  Experimentation	(needed to define enums)
|   Immutability first     				| You have to opt out of immutability explicitly											|  Exploration	(needs new design using muttable keyword)
|   Juxtaposition 			   			| support for simple juxtaposition that enables units like `2 kg`							|  Experimentation	(explore other uses besides units) 
|   Native code and Peers 				| support implementation delegation to the native platform									|  Experimentation	(not clear interaction with native modules)
|   Operator Overloading     			| Operators are related to type interfaces and follow mathematical concepts					|  Exploration	(needed the concept of meta type)
|   Reification							| support availability of generic type parameter information at runtime						|  Experimentation	(not clear interaction with 'is' operator) 
|   Reflection 							| allow code to inspect modules,classes and members											|  Exploration	(not clear from where/how to load information) 
|   Monads								| support for monads and monadic operations.												|  Exploration (needed the concept of meta type)
|   Native inter-op 					| call native code directly from lense code without delegation								|  Envision	(not clear interaction with native modules) 
|   Meta type							| meta types are for classes what classes are for instances. Also known as shapes			|  Envision (not clear to define a syntax)
|   Lambdas								| function objects made easy																|  Envision (not clear is should use lambda or closure)
