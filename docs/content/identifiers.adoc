== Valid identifiers

In Lense, identifiers must start with a letter, followed by any combination of characters and digits. No special symbols allowed.

Identifiers are all names you use in the programs to name variables, methods, properties, fields, classes and modules


== Reserved words and keywords

Lense, like all languages, reserves some words that cannot be used as identifiers. 
Some of these reserved works are keywords, e.i. they have special meaning to the compiler. 
Some other are reserved to prevent use or for use in future versions.

Follows a short description of each keywords uses.

.Uses of each keyword
|=== 		
| abstract  	| Indicates a type cannot be instantiated 
| as 			| Used to define an alias type name for an imported type.
| assert		| Verifies a condition, and is not satisfied, throws an exception
| break 		| Instructs loops  to terminate immediately
| case 			| Indicates a possible value in a `switch` selection
| catch 		| Part of the exception capturing clause known as try-catch-finally 
| class 		| Indicates a type that participates in single inheritance
| constructor 	| Set of instructions that produce an instance of a class 
| continue 		| Instructs loops  to jump to the next iteration
| default 		| Indicates "all others not specified" in a switch selection. Also indicates the method implementation can be overwritten
| else 			| Indicates an alternative for an `if` decision
| enhancement 	| Indicates a type that provides methods as extension for an existing type 
| export 		| Indicates a class is visible outside the module 
| extends 		| Uses to indicate inheritance 
| false			| The constant false value, of the instances of Boolean.
| final 		| Indicates a class cannot be inherited
| finally 		| Part of the exception capturing clause known as try-catch-finally 
| for 			| Indicates a for-each loop. 
| get 			| Indicates the instructions for an acessor
| given 		| Indicates a constraint in a generic type variable
| if 			| Indicates a decision based on a truth value of a condition
| implements 	| Indicates the type obeys to the contract of a given set of interfaces 
| implicit 		| Indicates a constructor that the compiler will use implicitly to transform between types
| import 		| Indicates a type that is used in the code
| in 			| Indicates contra-variant type variable
| interface 	| Indicates a type that participates in multiple inheritance
| inv 			| Indicates an invariant type variable
| is 			| Used in a generic constraint to indicate the type (ex.: `given T is Comparable<T>`). Used as an operator to determine if an instance is of the given type (ex.: `a is Integer`).Also used to indicate possible derived types
| let 			| Indicated the definition of a immutable variable
| module 		| Begins the declaration of a module
| mutable 		| Indicates a property or variable can be reassigned
| native 		| Indicates a type or method in implemented in the platform language and not in Lense.
| new 		 	| Invokes a constructor
| none 			| The single object that is a possible instance of Maybe that carries no information
| object 		| Indicates a class with a single instance
| out 			| Indicates a co-variant type variable
| override 		| Indicates the method overrides a default, or abstract, method defined in the parent type
| package 		| Indicates the package  in which the type belongs
| private 		| Indicates the type member is not visible to any type members of other types. Is visible only to members of the same type
| protected 	| Indicates the type member is visible only the type it self and to types that inherit from the declaring type
| public 		| Indicates the type member is visible to type members of other types 
| return 		| Interrupt a method, possibly with a given result
| satisfies 	| Indicates the type obeys to the contract of a given set of type classes 
| satisfy 		| Indicates the method implementation is consistent with a method in a type class
| sealed 		| _(not currently used)_
| set 			| Indicated the implementation of a modifier
| super			| Used to refer to the parent type instance 
| switch		| Indicates a decision between different possibilities
| this			| Used to refer to the current instance, itself 
| throw			| Used to raise an exception
| true			| The constant true value, of the instances of Boolean.
| try 			| Part of the exception capturing clause known as try-catch-finally 
| type 			| Modifier that indicates the definition of a type class 
| typeOf 		| Operator to determine the type of an instance of type literal
| value			| Modifier that indicates the definition of a value class 
| while			| Indicates a while loop or terminates a do-loop
